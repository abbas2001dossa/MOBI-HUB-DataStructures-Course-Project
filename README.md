# MOBI-HUB-DataStructures-Course-Project
The following project is based on c++, whic depicts how to carry big data with dataStructures.

My project would analyze and utilize big data in such a way that users could search mobile phones upon their feasible classification (color, price, brand etc).
Furthermore, we would use DATA SCRAPPING to scrap data from online websites, and then break the data into multiple clusters by clustering to further  analyze the data by solving the following problems: 
1 - Data selection/Extraction
2 - Data filtering
3 - Summarizing
4 - noise 
5 - clustering and classification.

The available data set would be extracted from data scrapping as mentioned earlier. 
For solving the problems our system would present simplicity such that itâ€™s not limited to any age group. 
The system would also present perfectness, such that accurate data structure algorithms would be used to accurately process and utilize big data, such that the users would benefit from time complexity.
